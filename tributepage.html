    <h1>A TRIBUTE TO MY ROLE MODEL</h1>
    <p>Some years back, I remembered being asked who my role model was and my reply was that I do not have any as at that time as I do not have anyone that really fits into the definiton below: <br> <em><strong>"A role model is someone who serves as an example to others, inspiring and guiding them through thier actions, behaviors and attitudes"</strong></em></p>
    <h3>ABOUT MY ROLE MODEL</h3>
    <P><strong>Olusoji Abosede Victoria</strong> is my maternal cousin and a native of Abeokuta, Ogun State. 
        She is a graduate of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta where she studied Agricultural Administration. 
        She is currently running a master's programme in the same University studying the same course.  She is a lover of God, an Educator and a proud mother of one. One might think why will a graduate of Agricultural Administration decided to be an educator, the answer is not far fetched, this is because she finds pleasure in loves to just because she likes to encourage and motivate people especially teenagers and youths</P>

    <p>To think that I've had such a wonderful person around me for a long time and I wasn't aware until I had the chance to properly meet you. 
        You fit properly into the definition of a Role Model in my life. 
        Your love for God, your family, what you do and people aroud you is one of the reasons why I look up to you. 
        Your unrelenting attitude, the way you are never tired of trying, the way you see possibility even in all impossibilities.
        The way you listen to my excuses and show me I can do away with them, the way you celebrate my little wins and you are always so happy for me.
        The way you can talk to me about anything and everything without looking at the age difference. Your advices have never gone wrong, not even once!!! <br>
        In you, I found a mother, sister, friend, teacher and mentor. <br> <br>Thank you for all that you do 
        <br>Thank you for your prayers 
        <br>Thank you for where you stand in the family <br>I can't thank you enough or all that you are<br>I love you so much my superwoman!!!</p>
